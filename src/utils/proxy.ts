 * Where this run goes out from is decided here, in code, not by the input. On DHGate the proxy is
 * not really a preference: the site is behind Cloudflare, and a run coming from the container's own
 * IP draws the interactive "Verify you are human" variant far more often — and, once a session is
 * burnt, has no second IP to retry from. Residential US is the exit that measured best, so that is
 * what every proxied run gets.
 *
 * The input keeps exactly one lever over this, `enableProxy`: on, and the settings below are used;
 * off, and no proxy is created at all. Anything more granular (groups, country, custom URLs) would
 * be a knob whose only sensible position is the one already set here.
