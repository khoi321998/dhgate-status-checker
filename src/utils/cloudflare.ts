/**
 * DHGate sits behind a Cloudflare challenge ("Just a moment…"), in two flavours.
 *
 * It is not an IP ban: the same IP answers 200 to curl with a plain Chrome User-Agent, and to a
 * real Google Chrome. What trips it is the browser fingerprint — an automated browser gets
 * challenged, and then has to prove itself by running Cloudflare's JS for a few seconds.
 *
 * Two consequences for the crawler:
 *
 * 1. The interstitial is served with **HTTP 403**, which is exactly what `detectBlocked` treats as
 *    a refusal. We used to throw on it immediately — three retries, three challenges, `FETCH_FAILED`
 *    — while the challenge sitting in that very tab would have cleared itself a second later.
 * 2. Once cleared, Cloudflare navigates the tab to the real page on its own. Crawlee never sees
 *    that second navigation, so `ctx.response` keeps reporting the challenge's 403 for a document
 *    that is, by then, the product page.
 *
 * So {@link passCloudflare} runs the whole gate as one post-navigation step, in three moves:
 *
 * - wait the non-interactive variant out ({@link settleCloudflareChallenge}),
 * - if waiting is not enough, tick the "Verify you are human" checkbox (Crawlee's
 *   `handleCloudflareChallenge`, which clicks it with a real mouse event — the widget lives in a
 *   cross-origin iframe, so a click at the right coordinates is the only way in),
 * - and stop trusting the recorded status once we are through ({@link effectiveStatus}).
 *
 * Two things outside this file do most of the work of *not* being challenged in the first place:
 * `main.ts` launches the real Google Chrome rather than the bundled Chromium (see utils/browser.ts
 * for why that matters more than anything in here), and it runs headed — headless never cleared the
 * challenge in testing, no matter how long it was given.
 */

/**
 * Read a timeout from the environment, falling back to `fallback` for unset or unparseable values.

 * throttled, page work scales close to linearly: 4x throttle ≈ 4x the wall clock, 8x ≈ 10x. So a

/**
 * Where the "Verify you are human" checkbox actually is.
 *
 * Crawlee's helper aims at `.main-content div` with a fixed `+30, +25` offset, and on DHGate's
 * interstitial that is simply the wrong element. The page reads:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div class="main-content">
 *   <div class="lpdkQ3"><img …><h1>www.dhgate.com</h1></div>   ← first div: the site header
 *   <h2>Performing security verification</h2>
 *   <div id="lVJB5"><div><div>
 *     <div></div>                                              ← the widget
 *     <input type="hidden" name="cf-turnstile-response">
 * ```
 *
 * `.main-content div` matches the header, so the clicks landed at (222, 153) — on the heading text,
 * about 185px above a checkbox sitting at (213, 337). Ten clicks into empty space, which is exactly
 * what the platform run showed.
 *
 * Looking for the widget's `<iframe>` does not help either: Turnstile mounts it inside a **closed
 * shadow root** on that empty `<div>`, so `querySelectorAll('iframe')` returns nothing and
 * `page.content()` serializes nothing — which is why the saved HTML has no iframe in it at all
 * while the screenshot plainly shows the widget.
 *
 * What *is* reachable is the hidden input Turnstile writes its token into. `cf-turnstile-response`
 * is Cloudflare's own API contract — the name a site reads the token back from — so unlike the
 * hashed `lpdkQ3` class names around it, it is stable. Measure from there.
 *
 * Returning `undefined` leaves Crawlee's guess in place, which is the honest fallback: on a page
 * with no widget there is nothing better to aim at.

/**
 * The whole Cloudflare gate, as one post-navigation step.
 *
 * Waiting clears the non-interactive variant. What it never clears is the one with the "Verify you
 * are human" checkbox — for that, Crawlee's `handleCloudflareChallenge` aims a real
 * `page.mouse.click` (with a randomized offset) at where the widget renders, because the checkbox
 * lives in a cross-origin iframe that no selector of ours can reach into.
 *
 * That helper throws a `SessionError` when it finds the hard "Sorry, you have been blocked" page or
 * when the challenge survives its clicks. We deliberately let that propagate, because Crawlee
 * answers a `SessionError` by retiring the session before reclaiming the request — which is what
 * buys the retry a new IP and a new browser. Note that it *does* still cost one of the request's
 * three retries (`_requestFunctionErrorHandler` increments `retryCount` for every retryable error,
 * `SessionError` included); `maxSessionRotations` is a second, higher ceiling of 10, not a way
 * around `maxRequestRetries`.
